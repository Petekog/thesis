    "&emsp;The goal of our work is researching some approaches to solve the problem of maximizing the average number of pages read in multi-page publications. We want to learn how we need to lead the agent through the pages to cause her consuming as much content as possible. Unfortunately we have no special lab or resource to perform field experiments. That's why we need to build a good simulator that will mimic the agents behavior when she visits the pages we try to maximize the number of views.  \n",
    "&emsp;The simulator receives from the outside directed graph that represents a structure of the content. Each vertex is a page and an edge from vertex A to vertex B express the link between page A and B, i.e. the next page that is presented to the agent after seeing page A may be page B.<br><br>\n",
    "The agent behavior simulator is the core part of this project. The simulation is performed as following:<br>\n",
    "    &emsp;**1)** At each round the agent is at some vertex of the graph - this is an abstraction for the agent looking at some page that we presented to her.<br>\n",
    "    &emsp;**2)** On the same round, after watching the page, the agent chooses one of three actions: go to the next page, return to the previous page ( the one she saw at the previous round ), or stop watching the pages and leave.<br>\n",
    "    &emsp;**3)** If the agent selected the \"next page\" action, the simulator choose the next page to present to the agent. <br>\n",
    "    &emsp;**4)** The round finishes and the next round starts.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;In this program we focus on second and the first step, the second step depends on the first one. We can think of it as if the agent liked the picture (or the sequence of pictures) or found it to be interesting and want to see the next one, or the opposite case, when she is bored with the current picture (or sequence of presented pictures) and don't want to keep watching.\n",
